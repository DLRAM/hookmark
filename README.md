# Hookmark

An extension for rating the web and making your browsing experience better than ever. Read more about it [here](https://haridarshan.hashnode.dev/introducing-hookmark)

### Update
Firefox extension was under review, it is now available here https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hookmark/ 
> it doesn't support the hooking and exporting feature in firefox as it was mainly intended for chrome but the rest of the features (fortunately all the  major ones) are 
> available

They available features for firefox are:
1. **Rating and adding comments for websites**
2. **Getting the ratings and comments on hover**
3. **Getting recommendations to the right side with the newly found ratings**
4. **Like the comments**

**Basically all the functionality with all fine details except for the below popup**

Give it a try and stay tuned for the chrome version(the developer account is under review) which was the preferred platform and has the hooking and export/import hooks as well

> Meanwhile for the curious ones follow the steps mentioned [here](https://haridarshan.hashnode.dev/introducing-hookmark#heading-using-the-frontend) to use the 
> extension even before it is available to the public (only for chrome users, however that's what we need now ðŸ˜Š)
